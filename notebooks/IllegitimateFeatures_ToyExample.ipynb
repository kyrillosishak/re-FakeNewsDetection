        "One specific form of data leakage involves selecting features that directly influence the target variable, thereby giving the model access to information it would not have in a real-world scenario. For example, if a feature is chosen based on its direct correlation with the target variable—perhaps through data that includes future outcomes or results—this feature will unfairly boost the model’s accuracy during training. When the model is evaluated on unseen data, it may not perform as well because it has been trained with features that directly reveal the target variable. This scenario creates an unrealistic impression of the model’s capabilities and can lead to misleading conclusions about its effectiveness, ultimately compromising its reliability and generalization to new, real-world data."

This is because the model learns that if took_antibiotic_medicine is False, the patient didn’t have pneumonia. During validation, this pattern repeats, leading to misleadingly high performance. However, in real-world scenarios, predictions are made before knowing if a patient has received antibiotics, leading to poor model accuracy. To avoid this, exclude features updated or created after the target variable is known.\n",

        "This analysis demonstrates the impact of data leakage on model performance. Initially, a machine learning model is trained using all available features, including those that are likely to cause leakage such as `expenditure` and `share`. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of over 98% during cross-validation, but this high accuracy is misleading because it includes information that wouldn’t be available in a real-world scenario. By excluding these leaky predictors, which are derived from the target variable or are closely related to it, the model’s cross-validation accuracy drops to around 84%. This significant decrease highlights how the model was initially overfitting to information that wouldn’t be accessible at the time of prediction."
