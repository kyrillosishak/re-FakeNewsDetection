        "In machine learning, ensuring that models generalize well to unseen data is paramount. However, a subtle yet pervasive issue known as data leakage can severely compromise this goal. Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset slips into the model, artificially boosting performance during evaluation. This can lead to overly optimistic results that fail in real-world scenarios. Among the various forms of data leakage, feature selection is particularly insidious, as it can occur at multiple stages of the machine learning pipeline and often goes unnoticed.\n",

        "**Illustration:** Consider the word ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù that is rare in the training set but common in the test set. Due to data leakage, the IDF calculated during training would reflect the high frequency of ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù in the test set, reducing its importance.

Since ‚Äúbanana‚Äù is more frequent in the test set, its importance (TF-IDF score) in the test set is not as high as it would be if the IDF was calculated on the training data alone. This is because the IDF is lower (indicating more common) when considering the whole dataset, thus reducing the overall TF-IDF score for ‚Äúbanana‚Äù in the test set.\n",

Because ‚Äúbanana‚Äù is less frequent in the training set than it is in the full dataset (or the test set), its IDF value is higher. This results in higher TF-IDF scores in both the training and test sets when the test set is transformed using the training-based TF-IDF vectorizer.

        "-   **Explanation (Data Leakage Effect):** Since ‚Äúbanana‚Äù is less frequent in the test set, its importance (TF-IDF score) in the test set is higher as it would be if the IDF was calculated on the training data alone. This is because the IDF is greater (indicating more common) when considering the whole dataset, thus increasing the overall TF-IDF score for ‚Äúbanana‚Äù in the test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Explanation (No Data Leakage Effect):** Because ‚Äúbanana‚Äù is more frequent in the training set than it is in the full dataset (or the test set), its IDF value is lower. This results in lower TF-IDF scores in both the training and test sets when the test set is transformed using the training-based TF-IDF vectorizer. The lower IDF value (due to ‚Äúbanana‚Äù being more common in training data alone) emphasizes ‚Äúbanana‚Äù less in the test set when calculated correctly without data leakage.\n",
